Explanation about your exercise:
In this exercise, I implemented, GField - object that reperesnt, Gaula's Field
GFNumber - number in Gaula's Field
Implemented, brute force algorithm to find the prime factorial of number (of type GFNumber)
Implemented, rho ford algroithm, which sometimes works, and find prime factorial of number
fater than the brute force approch, if not working, than find according to bruth force approch.
Implemented, isPrime function, to find if a number is prime or not. complexity -  O(sqrt(n)).
dynamically allocated array, and freed the memory in the destructor.
